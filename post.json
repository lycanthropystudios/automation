                "The Spaniard, who is returning to Formula 1 this season after a two-year absence, is conscious and well in himself, according to his Alpine team."
                "Alpine said Alonso would have further medical examinations on Friday, without confirming whether he was in hospital."
                "Sources close to Alonso say he was hit by a car near his Lugano home and the indications are he has a jaw fracture."
                "It is said that he will be taken to Bern, where there is a specialist unit to deal with such injuries."
                "The incident raises questions as to whether Alonso will be fit to start the season in Bahrain next month."
                "Pre-season testing is to be held in Bahrain from 12-14 March, before the first race on 26-28 March."
                "Alonso, a winner of 32 Grands Prix and world champion in 2005 and 2006, left F1 at the end of 2018 after four seasons with an uncompetitive McLaren to pursue other" "interests in racing.""
